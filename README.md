# High Torque Pedals
High torque pedals built for uphill bicycles/tricycles and other human powered machines.

# The issue with classical pedals
Regular bicycle pedals suffer from inconsistency in power delivery along with poor ergonomics. The required circular motion of the foot on the pedals makes pedaling while standing less comfortable. The classical pedals are made mostly for pedaling while sitting.

# The issue with classical pedals - Power delivery
Regular bicycle pedals deliver power in an alternating form. When the pedals are in a vertical position, most of the applied force is directed towards the center of rotation of the pedals thus generating a very small moment. When the pedals are in a horizontal positions, the pedals produce the maximum amount of moment because the applied force is perpendicular to the distance from the pedal end to the center of rotation.

This highly alternating power delivery makes pedaling using the classical pedals exhausting -especially uphill- where the rider needs to make a large effort to accelerate from a stop (speed 0) with pedals in a vertical position and needs to keep a constant pace to gain momentum which makes their next stroke not on a vertically-positioned pedals.

# The issue with classical pedals - Poor ergonomics
The required circular movement makes pedaling while standing uncomfortable. If the rider is accelerating from a stop uphill they need to position their leg in a high angle to get the bicycle/tricycle starting. This puts extra strain on the feet joints and makes it challenging to accelerate.

# The issue with bicycles uphill
Bicycles -as opposed to tricycles- requires that the rider makes a constant effort and sets a minimum speed for them to keep up with to stay balanced. This puts pressure on riders to commit to a certain pace of effort that exhausts them on the long run especially in an uphill environment where a constant force is needed to climb.

Tricycles on the other hand eliminate the balance problem. Although a third wheel on the ground means higher friction and more weight -weight in the frame as well-, the gained options of slow pedaling and climbing and stopping/starting at the riders own pace, outweights the other flaws.

# The issue with pedaling while sitting
Pedaling while sitting although is more comfortable, doesn't provide that much force and when it's provided
