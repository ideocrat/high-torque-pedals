# High Torque Pedals
High torque pedals built for uphill bicycles/tricycles and other human powered machines. An exploration of the application of the created pedals on a tricycle built for uphills.

# The issue with classical pedals
Regular bicycle pedals suffer from inconsistency in power delivery along with poor ergonomics. The required circular motion of the foot on the pedals makes pedaling while standing less comfortable. The classical pedals are made mostly for pedaling while sitting.

# The issue with classical pedals - Power delivery
Regular bicycle pedals deliver power in an alternating form. When the pedals are in a vertical position, most of the applied force is directed towards the center of rotation of the pedals thus generating a very small moment. When the pedals are in a horizontal positions, the pedals produce the maximum amount of moment because the applied force is perpendicular to the distance from the pedal end to the center of rotation.

This highly alternating power delivery makes pedaling using the classical pedals exhausting -especially uphill- where the rider needs to make a large effort to accelerate from a stop (speed 0) with pedals in a vertical position and needs to keep a constant pace to gain momentum which makes their next stroke not on a vertically-positioned pedals.

# The issue with classical pedals - Poor ergonomics
The required circular movement makes pedaling while standing uncomfortable. If the rider is accelerating from a stop uphill they need to position their leg in a high angle to get the bicycle/tricycle starting. This puts extra strain on the feet joints and makes it challenging to accelerate. Pedaling while standing on classical bike pedals is uncomfortable and requires a strong grip on the handles to keep the balance. As mentioned later, pedaling while standing is an integral part of creating a tricycle for uphills.

# The issue with bicycles uphill
Bicycles -as opposed to tricycles- require that the rider makes a constant effort and sets a minimum speed for them to keep up with to stay balanced. This puts pressure on riders to commit to a certain pace of effort that exhausts them on the long run especially in an uphill environment where a constant force is needed to climb and there is little to no momentum.

Tricycles on the other hand eliminate the balance problem. Although a third wheel on the ground means higher friction and more weight -weight in the frame as well-, the gained options of slow pedaling while climbing and stopping/starting at the riders' own pace, outweights the other flaws. Thus tricycles, even though slower, are built for endurance. The difference is similar to the one between between walking and running uphill. Although running is faster, it won't get you far enough with the same available energy. Walking on the other hand will preserve your energy and stretches it to a far longer distance.

# The issue with pedaling while sitting
Pedaling while sitting although is more comfortable, doesn't provide that much force on the pedals (10 to 15 kg of pressure by leg muscles). Pedaling while standing provides a much higher force on the pedal (the riders weight i.e. 55 Kg) and offers the rider a small break between each stroke when the pedal is going down. In other words, all the effort is made when the rider pushes their body up on the higher pedal and then "waits" until the pedal is down so that they stand on the other pedal which is now up.

Studies have shown that pedaling while sitting is bad for bone density since the weight of the body is rested on the seat while the muscles makes all the pressure on the pedal. No pressure on the leg bones is applied to preserve/increase their density. The calcium exits the body through sweat instead of being cemented in the bones of the legs.

# High Torque Pedals - General description
The High Torque Pedals are a combination of circular pedals with 4 points of pressure (instead of 2 for the regular pedals) with reciprocating pedals on top of the circular pedals. The center of rotation of the reciprocating pedals are on top back of the circular pedals. The stroke begins when the circular pedals is at an angle of 35 to 45 degrees from the vertical axis. This makes sure that the stroke always starts with a high pressure force on the pedals. As a result, acceleration is never an issue even in an uphill topography. The movement of the rider's legs are reciprocating (since they stand on the reciprocating pedals) making it easier to pedal while standing.

The design of these pedals is simple enough to be built anywhere and generally needs little to no maintenance. The pedals can be built from steel, stainless steel, aluminum, or other materials. The design is highly resilient and highly durable if built well.

# High Torque Pedals - Power delivery
Although the high torque pedals still deliver power in an alternating form, they do so with a much smaller difference between the maximum and minimum output. This almost constant power delivery ensures that every stroke needs a uniform effort as opposed to regular pedals which need an extra effort to start the pedaling stroke.

# High Torque Pedals - Ergonomics
The movement of the riders' legs will be reciprocating which is similar to walking up a uniform staircase. The force needed to climb the 1st step is the same for climbing any step along the uniform staircase. This is the main idea behind the High Torque Pedals -and tricycle- which is to make the difficulty of pedaling uniform for all uphill slopes. In that case, what changes from a low to a steep slope is the quantity of pedaling but not its difficulty.

Since the pedals are reciprocating, they will make pedaling while standing much easier and much more ergonomic.

# High Torque Pedals - Other applications
Although this documents thoroughly describes the application of the High Torque Pedals to a tricycle as a means of transport and small scale cargo movement, these pedals can be applied to any human powered machine and are encouraged to be used in that context. For example, they can power a drill, circular saw, lathe, potter's wheel, washing machine, pump, blender, mixer, siever, crane, shredder... They can also power a tricycle used for agriculture (push seeder, weed mower, harvest collection, fertilizer distribution, mulch shredder,...) or cargo transport.

These pedals can be fitted to a bicycle but for the reasons explained above, it is preferred to be fitted to a tricycle.
