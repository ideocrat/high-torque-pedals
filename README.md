# High Torque Pedals
High torque pedals built for uphill bicycles/tricycles and other human powered machines.

# The issue with classical pedals
Regular bicycle pedals suffer from inconsistency in power delivery along with poor ergonomics. The required circular motion of the foot on the pedals makes pedaling while standing less comfortable. The classical pedals are made mostly for pedaling while sitting.

# The issue with classical pedals - Power delivery
Regular bicycle pedals deliver power in an alternating form. When the pedals are in a vertical position, most of the applied force is directed towards the center of rotation of the pedals thus generating a very small moment. When the pedals are in a horizontal positions, the pedals produce the maximum amount of moment because the applied force is perpendicular to the distance from the pedal end to the center of rotation.

This highly alternating power delivery makes pedaling using the classical pedals exhausting -especially uphill- where the rider needs to make a large effort to accelerate from a stop (speed 0) with pedals in a vertical position and needs to keep a constant pace to gain momentum which makes their next stroke not on a vertically-positioned pedals.
